## Description

   Created originally using HTML, CSS and Javascript, this portfolio page has now been converted into React. It contains a hero section, an about section, a projects section and a footer. I have added in anchor tags in the nav bar to direct the user to the relevant sections on the page. 
   When a project card is clicked, the user shall be directed to the github deployed site.  
   When the social icons are clicked, the user should be directed to the relevant social pages.
